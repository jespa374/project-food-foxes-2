# Project ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥‘
This project was about creating a food review website inspired by Deliveroo and use Zomato API to fetch data about pizza restaurants in Dublin. 


# The problem
First the different endpoints of the API were tested to fetch different data for example, price,ratings etc. Then different features of the website such as sorting on price range and reviews was decided as features of the site. Since this was a group project, each person in the group was responsible for JavaScript features working with the API or styling and worked in separate branches and at the end the changes were all merged into the master branch.
